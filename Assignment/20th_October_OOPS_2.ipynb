    "\n",
    "1. `Number of Parent Classes:` In single inheritance, a class is derived from one base class, whereas in multiple inheritance, a class can be derived from more than one base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Complexity:` Single inheritance is less complex as there’s only one base class to look at when considering method resolution order (MRO). On the other hand, multiple inheritance can be more complex due to the possibility of the diamond problem, where there could be ambiguity in the path of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Code Reusability:` Both single and multiple inheritance support code reusability. However, multiple inheritance can potentially reuse more code as it allows a class to inherit features from multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Method Resolution Order (MRO)`: In single inheritance, MRO is straightforward as there’s only one path from the child class up to its parent. But in multiple inheritance, Python uses a specific MRO algorithm (C3 Linearization) to determine the order in which methods should be inherited in the presence of multiple parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Use Cases:` Single inheritance is commonly used in most real-world applications due to its simplicity and straightforwardness. Multiple inheritance is used in scenarios where a class needs to inherit properties from multiple unrelated classes (like mixins)."

    "The `diamond problem` refers to an ambiguity that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios in object-oriented programming languages. This problem occurs when a class (let’s call it Class4) inherits from two classes (Class2 and Class3) that both inherit from a common superclass (Class1). If there is a method “m” that is overridden in one or both of the parent classes (Class2 and Class3), then it’s ambiguous which version of the method “m” Class4 should inherit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, this problem is addressed by giving preference to the class that gets inherited first. This is determined by the order in which the parent classes are specified in the class definition. For example, if Class4 is defined as class Class4(Class2, Class3):, then it will inherit from Class2 before Class3. Therefore, if both Class2 and Class3 have a method “m”, then Class4 will inherit this method from Class2\n",

    "**Data hiding** is a key aspect of encapsulation where some of an object's attributes are hidden from other objects. This ensures that objects don't have direct access to each other's state, which can prevent unwanted side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a `BankAccount` class with a private `balance` attribute. With data hiding, the `balance` attribute is not visible to other classes or objects. This means that they can't directly modify the balance of a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the `BankAccount` class provides public methods (like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`) that allow other objects to interact with the balance. These methods serve as the interface to the `BankAccount` class, and they can include checks and validations to ensure that the balance is always in a valid state (e.g., it's not possible to withdraw more money than the current balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because it helps maintain the integrity of the data. If other parts of our code could directly modify the balance, it could lead to bugs or inconsistencies in our program. For example, an error in another part of your code could accidentally set the balance to a negative number.\n",
    "\n",

    "The use of getters and setters introduces an extra layer of method calls, which can lead to a slight decrease in performance. This is usually negligible, but in performance-critical applications, it could be a concern.\n",

For example, if we have a Car class, we can use this class to create multiple Car objects (like car1, car2, etc.), each with its own set of attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Code Modularity:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation also makes our code more modular. Each class we create becomes a self-contained module that includes specific attributes and methods. These classes (modules) can interact with each other through their public interfaces (methods), but their internal state is hidden from each other.

This leads to more reusable and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code.\n",

This ensures that regardless of the details of the individual class, all classes that implement the interface will have the same methods available.\n",

    "The benefits of using abstraction in large-scale software development projects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manage Complexity:** Large-scale software projects often involve complex systems with numerous interacting components. Abstraction allows us to hide the complexity of these components, making them easier to manage. We can focus on the high-level structure of the system without getting lost in the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve Modularity:** Abstraction promotes modularity by enabling us to encapsulate related functions and data into single units, or modules. Each module can be developed and tested independently, which simplifies the development process and makes the codebase more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance Code Reusability:** By defining abstract classes or interfaces, we can create reusable pieces of code. Other developers can use these abstractions as blueprints for their own classes, reducing duplication and improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Facilitate Teamwork:** In a large-scale project, different teams may work on different parts of the system. Abstraction provides a common language that all teams can use to understand and interact with each other’s code. This makes collaboration easier and more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Increase Maintainability:** With abstraction, changes made to one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts. This makes the system more maintainable, as bugs can be isolated and fixed without affecting the entire codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Promote Scalability:** Abstraction allows for easier scalability. As the software grows, new functionalities can be added as subclasses of existing abstract classes or new implementations of existing interfaces. This allows the software to evolve over time while maintaining a consistent structure.\n",

    "Method abstraction in Python is a concept that is closely related to polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming. It involves defining methods in an abstract base class that do not have any implementation. These methods must be implemented by any concrete (i.e., non-abstract) subclass that directly inherits from the abstract base class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Composition in Python, and in object-oriented programming in general, significantly enhances code maintainability and modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Maintainability:** Composition allows for greater flexibility since you can easily change parts of your system at runtime by substituting part objects. This makes maintaining your code easier because you can modify or replace components without affecting the rest of your system. For example, if a class Car is composed of an object Engine, and you want to upgrade the engine, you can simply replace the Engine object with a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Modularity:** Composition promotes modularity by enabling you to build complex systems from simpler, self-contained modules. Each component in a composite object works independently of the others. This means you can understand, develop, and test each component in isolation, making your code more manageable."
